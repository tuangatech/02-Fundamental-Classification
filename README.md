# Fundamental ML Techniques in Classification

Classification problems are some of the most common tasks in machine learning. The process is simple, usually starts by loading your data, label encoding categorical features, training aMLPClassifier, which is a neural network model, and predicting test results. In just 10 lines of code, you can achieve a baseline F1 score of 0.677.

What else we can do to have a better classification? In this article, I'll walk you through essential ML techniques for classification and beyond, like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, dealing with unbalanced datasets and evaluating classification model performance.

On the business side, approving an unqualified applicant often costs more than rejecting a qualified one - I'll also show how to handle these misclassification costs.

Here's what we'll cover:
- Understanding the Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Development
- Model Evaluation and Improvement
- Conclusion
